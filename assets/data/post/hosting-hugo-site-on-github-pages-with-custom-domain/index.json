Name your first repository with exact name as your website directory `YourProjectNanme` (Project that you created in your local machine) and for the second one,name it as **\\<YourUserName\\>.github.io**. This repository will contain static content created with Hugo.\n<p>Now, pull those repos to your local machine</p>\n<pre><code>cd &#x3C;YourProjectNanme>\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git\ncd YourUserName.github.io\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YourUserName.github.io.git\n</code></pre>\n<p>Initialize your <code>&#x3C;YourProjectNanme></code> folder with below Command</p>\n<pre><code>git init\n</code></pre>\n<p>And repo remotely with <code>remote</code> and <code>add</code> </p>\n<pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YourProjectName.git\ngit pull origin master\n</code></pre>\n</br>\n## Edit Config File\n<p>Before we commit our changes we need to edit <code>config.toml</code> (Located in Root Directory of your Project 'YourProjectName') and change Base URL.</p>\n<pre><code>baseurl = \"https://YourUserName.github.io\" // Change YourUserName with your GIthub Username \n--- OR ---\nbaseurl = \"https://MySpecialDomainName.com\" // Custom Domain Name \n</code></pre>\n</br>\n## Generate static content\nNow lets generate static content with Hugo\n```\nhugo -d ../YourUserName.github.io\n```\nAnd now Push our Hugo Code to github repository\n<pre><code>cd YourProjectName\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"your message\"\ngit push origin master\n</code></pre>\n<p>And Push Static content to github </p>\n<pre><code>cd YourUserName.github.io\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"your message\"\ngit push origin master\n</code></pre>\n</br>\n# Configuring Custom Domain\n<p>In order to use custom domain with our gitthub pages, we will have to configure <code>A</code> records for our domain (you can do this wil help of DNS Provider)</p>\n<p>Add below IP address as a  <code>A</code> records on your domain.</p>\n<pre><code>185.199.108.153\n185.199.109.153\n185.199.110.153\n185.199.111.153\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are two way to add custom domain to our project.\n1. Create a CNAME file in our root directory of the project\n2. Use <code>Settings</code> option from github project repo and add a custom domain.</p>\n<h5 id=\"we-are-going-with-option-2\"><a href=\"#we-are-going-with-option-2\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>We are going with option 2</h5>\n</br>\nOpen your github project repo **YourUserName.github.io** and navigate to settings page.Scroll down untill you see **GitHub Pages** section and there will be a option to add custom domain there.\n<p>Add your custom domain and click on save button.There is a also another check box <code>Enforce HTTPS</code>. check it (It will provide a layer of encryption and your site will be viewed over <code>HTTPS</code>).</p>\n<p>If you are using a <code>www</code> sub-domain, there are chances that you might not be able to check the <code>Enforce HTTPS</code> check-box.\nI was also receiving a <a href=\"https://dev.to/priteshusadadiya/privacy-error-with-custom-domain-in-and-github-pages-2ll2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Privacy error with custom domain</a> and i solved it by changing a DNS record.</p>\n<p>I had added the CNAME record (you can add this using DNS Provider)</p>\n<pre><code>www CNAME priteshusadadiya.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>Problem with above is that I was redirecting my <code>www</code> sub-domain to my apex(main) domain.</p>\n<p>I Solved this issue by changing my CNAME record to </p>\n<pre><code>www CNAME YourUserName.github.io // add your github.io url here\n</code></pre>\n</br>\n#### It takes around 48 hours for Github to generate HTTPS certificate on custom domain so, you might want to wait for it.\n<p></br></br>\nðŸ™Œ <strong>Congratulations,</strong> your website is now live and can be seen at  <strong>\\&#x3C;YourUserName>.github.io</strong></p>\n<h5 id=\"a-note\"><a href=\"#a-note\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>A Note:</h5>\n<p>I am documenting this entire process just in case i might need it in future. Maybe this can be useful to you too.</p>\n<p>Happy Coding.</p>\n","cover_image":null}},"context":{}}
