To increase the processing power of your applications so that it can reach to the end user in every corner of the world easily.</p>\n<p>No matter if you are a developer , Business owner , engineer or independent blogger.

He runs this blog on his own server.</p>\n<p>He has just started this new blog and the number of visitors on his blog are limited to 50 to 500. In this particular case jacks own server is more that enough to handle that load. he is doing perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>After couple months his visitor count gets increased from 1000 to 10000 per day and now his server are getting exhausted because of the increased traffic , so jack decides to increase his hardware (Hard disk , Ram , Processor) and he buys new stuff and upgrades his server.</p>\n<p><strong>After several months guess what happens ?</strong></p>\n<p>yup , you guessed it right . visitors count of the blog has gone way up and Jack is in trouble(again).</p>\n<h4 id=\"do-you-see-the-problem-here--here-are-couple-of-them\"><a href=\"#do-you-see-the-problem-here--here-are-couple-of-them\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Do you see the problem here ? here are couple of them.</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Jack will have to buy more stuff and upgrade his server manually every few months.</li>\n<li>Computer Hardware is not chip.

Keep with him in-case in future he decides to restart his blogging ?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now Jack can do all the above by himself or let some one else do it.

Would you remove windows and install Ubuntu ? or buy a new system and install it there ?</p>\n<p>Simple answer is <strong>NO</strong> for both option.</p>\n<p>What you will do is that you will install a software like <strong>virtual box</strong> that allows you to run more than one operating system at a time and once software is installed you can install and use Ubuntu in that environment without compromising your current system architecture.</p>\n<p>This environment is called <strong><strong>virtual Machine</strong></strong> .</p>\n<p>Now i think you will have a better understanding of what is cloud and why do we use it. </p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n<p><sup>This is a small portion of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@priteshusdadiya/advancing-the-future-of-cloud-computing-with-crowd-machine-72d9f324239d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">article</a> i published a long time ago</sup></p>\n","tags":[{"id":"cloud","path":"/tag/cloud/","title":"cloud"}],"category":[{"id":"Development","path":"/category/development/","title":"Development"}]}},{"node":{"title":"Customizing RSS Feed for Hugo Blog","path":"/post/customizing-rss-feed-for-hugo-blog/","date":"February 13, 2019","timeToRead":4,"cover_image":null,"description":"Hugo ships with its own `RSS 2.0` template that requires almost no configuration, or you can create your own RSS templates.\t","content":"<p>Hugo ships with its own <code>RSS 2.0</code> template that requires almost no configuration, or you can create your own RSS templates.\t</p>\n<p>However, there are few basic limitations to this like having complete <code>rss</code> feed, all pages and posts gets included, only summary of each post is included with RSS feed.\nSo when you implement default <code>rss</code> feed then you also limit your <code>RSS feed</code> for your blog with above parameters.</p>\n<p>Answer to this is to create your own <code>RSS</code> template.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-create-custom-rss-template-for-hugo\"><a href=\"#how-to-create-custom-rss-template-for-hugo\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How to create custom RSS Template for Hugo.</h2>\n<p>Below is the RSS template for Hugo.

This repository will contain static content created with Hugo.\n<p>Now, pull those repos to your local machine</p>\n<pre><code>cd &#x3C;YourProjectNanme>\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git\ncd YourUserName.github.io\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YourUserName.github.io.git\n</code></pre>\n<p>Initialize your <code>&#x3C;YourProjectNanme></code> folder with below Command</p>\n<pre><code>git init\n</code></pre>\n<p>And repo remotely with <code>remote</code> and <code>add</code> </p>\n<pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YourProjectName.git\ngit pull origin master\n</code></pre>\n</br>\n## Edit Config File\n<p>Before we commit our changes we need to edit <code>config.toml</code> (Located in Root Directory of your Project 'YourProjectName') and change Base URL.</p>\n<pre><code>baseurl = \"https://YourUserName.github.io\" // Change YourUserName with your GIthub Username \n--- OR ---\nbaseurl = \"https://MySpecialDomainName.com\" // Custom Domain Name \n</code></pre>\n</br>\n## Generate static content\nNow lets generate static content with Hugo\n```\nhugo -d ../YourUserName.github.io\n```\nAnd now Push our Hugo Code to github repository\n<pre><code>cd YourProjectName\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"your message\"\ngit push origin master\n</code></pre>\n<p>And Push Static content to github </p>\n<pre><code>cd YourUserName.github.io\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"your message\"\ngit push origin master\n</code></pre>\n</br>\n# Configuring Custom Domain\n<p>In order to use custom domain with our gitthub pages, we will have to configure <code>A</code> records for our domain (you can do this wil help of DNS Provider)</p>\n<p>Add below IP address as a  <code>A</code> records on your domain.</p>\n<pre><code>185.199.108.153\n185.199.109.153\n185.199.110.153\n185.199.111.153\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are two way to add custom domain to our project.\n1.
